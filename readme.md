# xdf_reader

Load and read .xdf file generated by LSL \
Simple adaptation of [pyxdf](https://github.com/xdf-modules/xdf-python/blob/d642dbf86f17b8dd94cce56ff339dd57e6d3774a/pyxdf/pyxdf.py) combined with a fix for erronous matrix multiplication in some cases

### Requirements: \
  ```Numpy```

### Usage:
Clone repository to folders
```from read_xdf import read_xdf``` \
```results, raw_data = read_xdf(path_to_xdf_file)```

Returns:

```results```: dict of information with stream_names as keys. \
```raw``` : The raw data returned by ```load_xdf```. \
           (Incase you the information you are looking for is not included in ```data```)
           
NOTE: these file run without installation of the pyxdf package, since this is an adaptation of that repository.
